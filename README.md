Pitch Notes

What it do:
------------
Touchless, gesture based ATM interface

Explain each screen, and the gestures used to interface with each one as the demo goes on

Highlight that thumbs up is a custom gesture



Benefits:
-------
In 2016, a study was conducted on nearly 100 NYC ATMs 

Accessibility: allows for more flexible ATM design, without need to include so much keypad space, people can use more comfortable positions and don't have to hunch over at a small window

Easier access to transaction history on the go could encourage smarter spending

Can integrate camera or fingerprint with the infrared camera, added security

A lot of ATM infrastructure is quite antiquated, and key loggers are easy to install


Challenges: 
----------
LeapMotion sensitivity varies a lot, some gestures easier to interpret than others

Could find better gesture software or trained more gestures with more time

Pivot from Java to Javascript because it was easier ot integrate into the webapp, but 4/5 of us had basically never used.



Improvements:
------------

Secure PIN: would like to include a way to create a unique gesture pattern instead of a 4 number code

Transaction history could also show withdrawal limit for the day

Option to select same transaction repeatedly
