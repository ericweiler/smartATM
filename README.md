Pitch Notes

What it do:
Touchless, gesture based ATM interface

Explain each screen, and the gestures used to interface with each one as the demo goes on

Highlight that thumbs up is a custom gesture

——

Flavor: In 2016, a study was conducted on nearly 100 NYC ATMs 

Accessibility: allows for more flexible Aim design, without need to include so much keypad space
Easier access to transaction history on the go could encourage smarter spending

Can integrate camera or fingerprint with the infrared camera, added security

A lot of ATM infrastructure is quite antiquated, and key loggers are easy to install

——
Challenges: 
LeapMotion sensitivity varies a lot, some gestures easier to interpret than others
Could find better gesture software or trained more gestures with more time
———

Improvements:

Secure PIN: would like to include a way to create a unique gesture pattern instead of a 4 number code
Transaction history could also show withdrawal limit for the day
Option to select sam transaction repeatedly
